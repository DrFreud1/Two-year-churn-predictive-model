# Two-year-churn-predictive-model
## Objective:
Develop a two-year churn predictive model.

### Description
You can find the soruce code in the Kin_Security_Predictor notebook, and the slides with the results of the project in the Consultant_Hackathon_AltScore pdf file. If you want to run the code yourself, you may create a python venv and install the libraries listed at requirements.txt

The python scripts contain code for validation metrics of the models in the notebook, we do that to summarize the code in the notebook.
